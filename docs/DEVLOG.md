# DEVLOG — Settlement Radio

The written record of decisions and changes, one entry per working session. The screen
recordings show *how*; this log captures *what changed and why* — the part video can't make
searchable, and the source material for the case study and "built in public" posts later.

## How to use this

- **One entry per session**, newest on top. Keep it fast (5 minutes) or it won't survive.
- Tie each entry to its evidence: the commit(s) for that session and the clip filename(s) in
  `devlog/`. The trio — entry + commit + clip — is one session's complete record.
- Once code exists, "Changed" overlaps with git commits; that's fine. The log's real value is
  **Decisions** and **Why**, which commits don't capture.
- When you write the case study, read this bottom-up (oldest first) — it's the story arc.

**Entry template (copy this):**

```
## YYYY-MM-DD — [Phase] — <one-line focus>
**Focus:** what this session was about, in a sentence.
**Decisions:** the durable choices (the things that matter in three months).
**Changed:** files/commits/accounts that concretely changed.
**Why:** the one or two reasons behind the key decision (your future self will thank you).
**Next:** the single next action.
Commit: <hash>  ·  Clips: <filenames in devlog/>
```

A typical *build* session will be short, e.g.:
> `## 2026-07-02 — Phase A — T3 script generation working`
> Focus: got Claude writing Vell's segment from canon. Decisions: cache the whole canon as one
> breakpoint. Changed: src/writer.py, README. Why: keeps input cost ~0.1x. Next: T4 (render to
> audio). Commit: a1b2c3 · Clips: 2026-07-02-first-script.mov

## 2026-06-16 — Phase A — T2 the Segment model (Seam #2)

**Focus:** built Seam #2 — the `Segment` dataclass — so segment length and lead-time become
dials on one code path instead of assumptions baked into the pipeline.

**Decisions (the durable ones):**
- **`Segment` matches the ARCHITECTURE.md spec verbatim**, dials and all: `length_target_sec`
  (required, no default — callers *must* dial it) and `lead_time_sec` (defaults 0). Keeping the
  shape identical to the doc means later phases plug in without a rewrite.
- **`length_target_sec` is a required field, not defaulted.** Forcing it at construction is the
  enforcement of "never hardcode length" — there's nowhere for a magic 300 to hide.
- **`disclosure` defaults `True`; `meta` is a `field(default_factory=dict)`** open bag for
  per-format extras, so the dataclass stays stable as formats grow.

**Changed:**
- New: `src/segment.py`. No other files touched (writer/produce consume it in T3–T4).

**Why:** making length and lead-time *inputs* is what later lets one `make_segment` serve a
3-hour overnight block and a 60-second near-live drop — only the numbers and the model/TTS tier
change, never the code path.

**Verification:** `python3 -c "from src.segment import Segment; print(Segment(id='demo-001',
format='talk', length_target_sec=300))"` constructs and prints a fully-populated Segment
(dials + `disclosure=True` + empty `meta`). No length is hardcoded anywhere else.

**Next:** T3 — `src/writer.py`: Claude writes Vell's ~5-min segment from the canon, canon passed
as the cache breakpoint.

## 2026-06-14 — Phase A — T1 provider abstraction (the two vendor seams)

**Focus:** built Seam #1 — the only two modules that touch a vendor SDK — so every later
task talks in logical tiers/voices and never imports `anthropic`/`elevenlabs` directly.

**Decisions (the durable ones):**
- **Tiers map to real IDs inside `llm.py`, nowhere else.** `haiku`→`claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`,
  `sonnet`→`claude-sonnet-4-6` (default), `opus`→`claude-opus-4-8`. Unknown tier raises early.
- **`cached_context` is a real cache breakpoint from day one.** It's placed *first* in the
  system prompt with `cache_control: ephemeral`, and the small per-call `system` text follows
  it — caching is a prefix match, so the stable canon must precede the volatile part. (Phase A
  prefixes may be below the model's min cacheable size and silently not cache; the path is still
  in use and grows into Phase B free.)
- **`generate` is plain text-in/text-out — no thinking.** Simplest general-purpose seam and
  keeps text cost trivial; a thinking knob can be added later without changing callers.
- **TTS backend chosen by `TTS_PROVIDER`; `kokoro`/`orpheus` raise a clear `NotImplementedError`
  stub.** Logical voice `vell_night` → ElevenLabs "Adam" (`pNInz6obpgDQGcFmaJgB`), the only place
  a vendor voice id appears. `emotion` is accepted but reserved (no vendor knob wired yet).

**Changed:**
- New: `src/providers/llm.py`, `src/providers/tts.py`, `src/__init__.py`,
  `src/providers/__init__.py`. Updated `README.md` (provider-seams section).
- Created a throwaway `src/_scratch_t1.py`, ran it, deleted it (+ its `segments/_test.mp3`).

**Why:** isolating both vendors behind one function each is what later lets us swap models,
swap TTS to self-hosted, and share one code path between overnight batch and 60-sec near-live —
without touching anything upstream.

**Verification:** `python -m src._scratch_t1` made a live Claude call (returned a greeting) and
a live ElevenLabs call (`segments/_test.mp3`, 24,703 bytes, confirmed real MPEG layer-III audio
via `file`). Both keys read from `.env`. Scratch + artifact deleted afterward.

**Next:** T2 — the `Segment` dataclass (Seam #2), so segment length/lead-time become dials.

## 2026-06-14 — Phase A — T0 repo scaffold (skeleton + venv)

**Focus:** stood up the reproducible project skeleton so the build has somewhere to live —
no pipeline logic yet, just the tree, ignores, deps, and the env template.

**Decisions (the durable ones):**
- **`.gitkeep` to version the empty dirs.** `segments/` and `assets/` are gitignored, but the
  dirs ship in git via a `.gitkeep` each (ignore `segments/*` but un-ignore the keep file), so a
  fresh clone has the tree the pipeline expects without committing generated audio.
- **`.env.example` holds every Phase A setting, not just T1's.** Added `ICECAST_SOURCE_PASSWORD`
  (T5) now with a working local default (`hackme`) so the human fills keys once. Vendor voice IDs
  stay **out** of env — the `vell_night` → real-id map lives in the `tts.py` registry per Seam #1.
- **Loose lower-bound pins** in `requirements.txt` (`anthropic>=0.40`, `elevenlabs>=1.0`,
  `python-dotenv`, `requests`) — simplest reproducible install for a solo Phase A.

**Changed:**
- Created the tree: `src/`, `src/providers/`, `config/`, `segments/` + `assets/` (gitignored,
  with `.gitkeep`).
- New files: `.gitignore`, `.env.example`, `requirements.txt`, `README.md` (setup + layout).
- Created `.venv/` (Python 3.13.5, satisfies 3.11+) and installed all deps.

**Why:** a clean, clone-and-run skeleton up front means every later task (T1→T6) just drops a file
into a known place; the `.env.example`-completeness + `.gitkeep` choices both exist to make
"fill keys once, then it works from a fresh clone" true.

**Verification:** `pip install -r requirements.txt` succeeds in the fresh venv; all four deps
import; `git check-ignore` confirms `.env` and `segments/*.mp3`/`assets/*.mp3` are ignored while
`.gitkeep` stays tracked. Tree matches CLAUDE.md → "Repo conventions".

**Next:** T1 — the provider abstraction (`llm.py` + `tts.py`), pending API keys in `.env`.

## 2026-06-13 — Phase 0 (planning) — Project shape, name, and the full doc pack settled

**Focus:** turned a broad idea into a decided plan — architecture, funding angle, name, and the
document set that drives the build — before touching Claude Code.

**Decisions (the durable ones):**
- **Architecture = hybrid, no hardware bought.** Cheap always-on CPU VPS (Hetzner CX22, ~€4/mo)
  for 24/7 playout; generation via on-demand/serverless GPU or APIs; YouTube Live as the free,
  unlimited-listener relay. Chosen over buying a Mac Mini.
- **Anthropic angle = "powered by Claude," honestly framed.** Anthropic supplies all
  intelligence + the whole build (Claude Code); voice is the one external piece (no Anthropic
  TTS exists). Realistic Anthropic support is *being featured*, not big credits (those need
  institutional equity funding); fund usage via small self-serve credits + Claude on AWS/GCP
  credits. So the MVP's job is to be **featurable**.
- **MVP scope:** 2 DJs, 1 show, 3 formats, small real canon, batch-only generation + one 60-sec
  near-live demo, content-safety gate + AI disclosure, built by Claude Code and documented in
  public. Everything bigger is explicitly deferred.
- **Name = Settlement Radio.** Verified clean at the brand/trademark level (no station, podcast,
  or media brand uses it). Worldbuilding justification: "settlement" is a *linguistic fossil* —
  the worlds are mature city-planets but still called the settlements out of six-century habit.
- **In-world year = real year + 600, computed at generation time** — never hardcoded (so it
  never goes stale).
- **Model routing:** Sonnet 4.6 default writing brain; Haiku 4.5 for high-volume/near-live;
  Opus 4.8 for rare hard reasoning; Fable/Mythos not workhorses. **Batch API + prompt caching
  mandatory** — text cost stays near-trivial; TTS is the real cost driver.
- **Voice:** ElevenLabs free tier now, behind the TTS abstraction, swappable to Kokoro/Orpheus.
- **Two load-bearing seams:** provider abstraction (swap model/voice/local↔cloud) and the
  Segment abstraction (segment length + lead-time as parameters → batch and near-live share one
  path).
- **Infra identity:** create a GitHub **org** `settlementradio` (org name is the scarce asset),
  repo lives inside. Buy the **domain first**; use Cloudflare free Email Routing to forward a
  branded address into a dedicated project inbox; register *all* project accounts to that, not
  personal email.
- **Habit:** devlog + screen recordings from Phase 0 (Cmd+Shift+5 now, asciinema for terminal
  sessions, OBS later — it doubles as the Phase C streaming tool).

**Changed (documents produced/updated this session):**
- Created the four-file Claude Code pack: `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/CANON.md`,
  `docs/PHASE_A_TASKS.md`.
- Created `docs/ROADMAP.md` (the single who-does-what-when path: Phase 0 → A → B → C → D →
  Beyond).
- Created the strategy set: funding & licensing kit, the Anthropic-anchored build plan, the
  marketing strategy.
- Updated docs with: the Settlement Radio name, the floating-year fix, the "linguistic fossil"
  canon note, and the model-routing + batch/caching rules (in CLAUDE.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, and
  PHASE_A_TASKS.md).

**Why (the key reasons):**
- Hybrid over hardware: near-zero up-front cost, fits €0–40/mo, and credits subsidize cloud/API
  but never a hardware purchase.
- Settlement Radio over prettier names: the cozy-audio namespace is crowded, so plain + verified
  beats evocative + taken; it also ties to the canon's "settlement time."
- Just-in-time task packs: only Phase A is detailed on purpose; B–D get written when reached, so
  they're informed by what Phase A actually teaches.

**Next:** execute Phase 0 — buy the domain (everything hangs off it), set up the forwarding
inbox, claim handles + the GitHub org, install Claude Code, get Anthropic + ElevenLabs API keys,
stand up the coming-soon page, start recording. Then in Claude Code: create the repo in the org,
upload the four-file pack, run `PHASE_A_TASKS.md` from T0.
