"""Program format templates (PHASE_B_TASKS.md B5) — reusable show backbones.

Each template is a function `(now, context) -> Segment` that fills a proven
skeleton so generation isn't a blank page:

  * `news`       — sting → N in-world headlines → sign-off         (single DJ)
  * `talk`       — open → banter → music lead-in → close           (two DJs; wraps B4)
  * `music`      — DJ intro → a REAL curated track → back-announce (single DJ; D7.4)
  * `commercial` — a fictional in-world product spot, fresh copy   (single DJ; D8.0)
  * `promo`      — a station self-promo (same builder, promo mode) (single DJ; D8.0)

This module is the registry + dispatcher. Each format declares which cast it
needs; `make_format_segment` assembles exactly that slice of the world (via
`context.assemble` — the same cached-core + dynamic-now seam every writer uses)
and hands it to the template. The templates themselves live in sibling modules and
never touch the DB directly.
